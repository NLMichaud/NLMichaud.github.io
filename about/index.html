	<p>I'm a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management at the Univeristy of California, Berkeley, working with <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/~pdevalpine/"> Perry de Valpine </a>  and <a href="www.stat.berkeley.edu/~paciorek/"> Chris Paciorek </a>.  I work on developing the <a href="r-nimble.org">nimble R package </a>.  Currently, I am working on incorporating new varieties of MCMC samplers into nimble's MCMC framework, and on extending the nimble DSL to allow for new object types.</p>

    <p>Previously, I was a graduate student in the <a href="stat.iastate.edu">Department of Statistics</a> at Iowa State University, where my advisor was <a href="jarad.me"> Jarad Niemi </a>.  My research focused on using Bayesian methods to forecast disease outbreaks. Specifically, we developed hierarchcial models which allowed us to estimate outbreak parameters using information from other, similar outbreaks across time and space.  Additionally, we examined methods of combining "now-sourced" data (e.g. Google Flu Trends, HealthTweets Data) with traditional CDC ILINet data to improve forecasts. </p>

	<p>I am also interested in public health data visualisation -- I developed the CDCplot Shiny app which is available at  <a href="https://michaud.shinyapps.io/CDCPlot/">https://michaud.shinyapps.io/CDCPlot/</a>.</p>
